## Things that could've been done if more time was spent:

- More decomposition of the components. (For example: buttons, inputs, forms and results).
- Implement eslint for the code consistency and quality improvement.
- Use of library like Axios to perform async operations and handle responses.
- Use of some design reference for the better UI and improve UX for better experience.
- The use of tinyURL could be changed so that the API supports the QR and alias links.
- Better use of data structure and binding on the states used.
- Remove the unnecessary imports and assets.
- More GIT commits for better version control.
